# Golden Access ReadMe

## Requirements: 
In order to use our application, you must have a Google Chrome web browser.

## Installation:
1. Download the zip file with our project application.
Either download files from url: https://drive.google.com/file/d/1B_XpiY91xla_DtvoFgjbnh1W7_4uqX5D/view?usp=sharing 
Clone the repository in github: https://github.com/sarahyakum/GoldenAccess 

2. Open up your chrome browser

3. Click the extension icon (puzzle piece) in the top bar of the browser. The extensions pop up will pull up along with a list of all the extensions you currently have installed.

4. Click "Manage Extensions" to open up chrome extension manager or "chrome://extensions/" in your chrome browser.

5. Once the page for chrome extensions opens up. In the top right hand corner, turn on "Developer mode".
 
6. Once turned on, there are new options on top left. Click on the "Load unpacked" button to open up your File Explorer.

7. Navigate to the folder where our unzipped "Golden Access" folder is and hit select to upload the extension into your chrome extensions.

8. Now repeat step 3 to open up your extensions pop up but now Golden Access should be there.

9. Click on "Golden Access" and the extension side panel should open up and be ready to use!

If not you may need to toggle the extension on in the chrome extension manager.


## How to use:
Once the extension side panel is opened up.

### Hover Feature
Toggle the switch under hover feature to enable it.
   
Move your cursor on various spots of the website to get more explanation on the object's use.

* www.walmart.com: hover over the cart, search, walmart logo, and location detector
* https://memorialhermann.org: hover over title, nurse help line, search bar, and book an appointment
* www.txdmv.gov: hover over drop down, search, phone number, and home page

The information box will stay open to help elder users who might struggle with hand tremors or simply don't fully understand how the hover feature works - until they exit using the 'X'.

### Editing Websites Text
Click "Edit Website" to move to the page where one can modify the applications text

Under font type, choose between the various fonts: Arial, Courier New, Times New Roman, Verdana, Helvetica, Georgia, Garamond, Palatino, Brush Script MT, Comic Sans MS, Impact, Lucida Console and Consolas.

Under font size, use the slider to decide what size you want to change to. Size increases from left to right and decreases from right to left.

Click the checkboxes for: Bold, Italic and Underline to apply those styles.

Click "Apply Settings" to view changes on the currently open website.

Click "Reset" to return to the original website's format.

### Help Chat
Click "Open Help Chat"

Click "Send Link" and it will send the chat what webpage you are currently viewing

Each of the following links have hard coded responses to mimic a live chat with a human

* www.walmart.com: Can input any of the following ('hello', 'buy', 'return', 'help', 'cart', 'store', 'department', 'service', and 'hours')
You can use any number of words as long as the keywords are in the input (ex: "Where is the closest store to me?", "I want to return ____.")

* https://memorialhermann.org: Can input any of the following ('hello',  'near me', 'doctor', 'appointment', 'records', and 'portal')
You can use any number of words as long as the keywords are in the input (ex: "How can I schedule an appointment?", "I need to access my medical records.", "How do I login to the Patient Portal?")

* www.txdmv.gov: Can input any of the following ('hello',  'hours', 'call', 'help', 'license', and 'registration')
You can use any number of words as long as the keywords are in the input (ex: "What is the phone number?", "I want to renew my license.", "How can I complete my vehicles registration?")

## Limitations: 
The edit website function can only edit certain accessible text from the website, this may or may not include some text or headings. It also applies the edits to all possible text on the page. There may be some size limitation based on the website

The live chat function only has a limited number of responses since we can only provide answers to a few questions. Additionally, the responses cannot differentiate if multiple keywords are used, for example: If "Hello I need help" is inputted on the Walmart or the dmv site, the user will be provided with the responses for 'hello' since that is what is recognized first.

The hover feature has a limited amount of pop ups since these are static elements. In future we would hope this feature is more intuitive and allows for pop ups for most website objects and features.
