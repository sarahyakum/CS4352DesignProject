explains how your UI functions. Include specific
requirements for running your UI (e.g., test user ID/password, browser or
device settings). Instructions should be clear enough for anyone to set up and
run your UI. It’s your responsibility to include any installation requirements,
operating instructions, and any limitations in the implementation. Ideally, the
prototype should be executable without needing to install additional software.

Prepare a walkthrough video:
• Create a video demonstrating your UI that highlights all three tasks, keeping it
under 2 minutes. This video should walk through your UI, showcasing all
implemented interactions. Include narration or subtitles to ensure clarity.
• Upload your video to YouTube and share the link in the “ReadMe” document
